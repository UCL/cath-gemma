To run Emma you need to do the following steps:

-) Get the embedding file:

The program needs a file containing all distances between sequences in the form
sc1 sc2 DIST
sc1 sc3 DIST

and so on. sc1, sc2 and sc3 are the names of the sequences. 
The file does not need the full distance matrix, only the upper or lower triangular
distance matrix are enough

-) To run the script the file (which has to be called "emb") has to be in the folder 
you run the script from. The rest is like regular GeMMa, with the starting_clusters/name
setup. You can put multiple sequences per starting cluster, but initial tests showed that 
using just the cluster center is enough.
If you want to change the name or location of the "emb" file you need to change it in line 265
in lib/Cath/Gemma/Tool/HHSuiteScanner.pm

-) If you use only the cluster centers you later need a script to fill them up again for 
FunFhmmer. For that I have the refill_starting_clusters_embedding_gemma_faster.py script.
you run it as:
 
python3 refill_starting_clusters_embedding_gemma_faster.py --treedir trees/centers/simple_ordering.hhconsensus.windowed/ --clusterfile all.clstr --sequences all.faa --out_tree trees/filled/simple_ordering.hhconsensus.windowed/

all.clstr is the cdhit output file from clustering, and all.faa the fasta file of the sequences.

-) If you want to run MARC, you also need the reverse script, which after FunFhmmer wants to reduce all new starting clusters to their cluster centers again. For this there is reduce_funfams_to_starting_clusters.py

python3 reduce_funfams_to_starting_clusters.py --funfamdir mda1/ffout/mda1_centers_filled/funfam_alignments/ --clusterfile mda1_clust.clstr --sequences mda1_clust --out_sc round2/starting_clusters/round2

where mda1_clust.clstr and mda1_clust are the cdhit output from clustering mda1 in this case

-) If you want to check the FunFam quality according to the Sjolander metric you need the file funfam_up_quality_formula.py which you run as 

python3 funfam_up_quality_formula.py --funfam_folder funfams/ --ec_input ec_numbers 

where funfams/ is a folder containing all funnfams in .aln format as provided by FunFhmmer, and ec_numbers is a file with all available EC numbers for sequences in that FunFam in the form
seq1 1.2.3.4
seq2 1.2.3.4
seq3 1.2.3.3
